# Syrian Cities and Sites Web Application

## Introduction
This is a simple web application created using the Laravel framework.
It allows users to view, search, and add cities and the site to see from Syria. 
The application includes a search feature, pagination, user input validation, and custom CSS styling inspired by the Syrian flag. 
The goal is to make the application easy to use and visually appealing while following good programming practices.

--------------------

## Features

### 1. Search for Cities

The search feature allows users to quickly locate cities by typing part or all of a city's name into the search bar. This feature is implemented using Laravel's `when` method for conditional filtering and supports pagination to display the results in smaller, manageable pages.

#### How It Works

**User Input**:
- Users can type the name of a city into the search bar (e.g., "Damascus").
- The input is submitted to the server via an HTTP `GET` request.

**Controller Logic**:
- The `index` method in the `CityController` retrieves the `search` query parameter from the request.
- If the search input exists, Laravelâ€™s `when` method dynamically adds a `where` clause to filter the cities table by matching the `city_name` field with the provided input.
- The `like` operator and wildcard characters (`%`) are used to allow partial matching. For example, searching for "Dam" will return "Damascus."

**Pagination**:
- The filtered results are paginated using Laravel's `paginate` method, with 5 results per page.
- The `appends` method ensures that the search query remains in the URL, so users can navigate between pages without losing the search term.

**Blade Template**:
- The filtered results are passed to the `index.blade.php` view, which displays the city names as clickable links.
- If no cities match the search term, the application shows a friendly message like "No results found for 'Aleppo'."

**User Feedback**:
- The number of results is displayed to provide clarity to the user, e.g., "3 results found for 'Damascus'."

#### Code Example
```php
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $search = $request->input('search'); // Retrieve search input

    // Filter cities based on the search query
    $cities = City::when($search, function ($query, $search) {
        $query->where('city_name', 'like', "%{$search}%"); // Filter by matching city_name
    })->paginate(5)->appends(['search' => $search]); // Paginate and keep search query

    return view('cities.index', [
        'cities' => $cities,
        'search' => $search,
    ]);
}
```
-----------------------

## 2. Pagination
The application divides the list of cities into smaller pages to make navigation easier. Each page shows 5 cities. Pagination links are displayed at the bottom of the page, allowing users to move between pages easily.

**How it works:**
- The `paginate` method is used in the controller to limit the number of cities displayed per page.
- The `links` method is used in the Blade template to generate the pagination links automatically.
- The Pages now are numbered to make it easy for the user to navigate.

**Code:**
```php
// CityController.php
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $search = $request->input('search'); // Get the search query

    // Fetch filtered and paginated cities
    $cities = City::when($search, function ($query, $search) {
        $query->where('city_name', 'like', "%{$search}%");
    })->paginate(5)->appends(['search' => $search]); // Paginate with 5 results per page

    return view('cities.index', ['cities' => $cities]);
}

```
-----------------------

### 3. User Input Validation
The application uses Laravel's built-in validation to ensure that user inputs are correct before saving them to the database. This ensures data integrity and prevents invalid data from being processed. If the validation fails, the user is shown helpful error messages, making it easy to correct their inputs.

**How Validation is Implemented:**
- The `validate()` method is used in both the `store` and `update` methods of the `CityController`.
- The rules ensure:
    - The `city_name` and `tour_site_name` are required, must be strings, and cannot exceed 255 characters.
    - The `cost` field is required, must be numeric, and cannot be less than 0.
- If the inpute is left empty, it gives an error to alert the user about the error.

**Example Code:**
```php
// Validation in the CityController
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $validated = $request->validate([
        'city_name' => 'required|string|max:255',
        'tour_site_name' => 'required|string|max:255',
        'cost' => 'required|numeric|min:0',
    ]);

    City::create($validated);

    return redirect('/cities')->with('success', 'City added successfully!');
}

```
-----------------------

### 4. Custom Styling
The application is styled using custom CSS inspired by the colors of the Syrian flag. The design is clean, simple, and focused on providing a good user experience. Key elements like the navigation bar, forms, buttons, and pagination have been styled to ensure the application is visually appealing and easy to use.

---
**Key Styling Features:**

1. **Navigation Bar**:
    - The navigation bar is styled with a black background and white text.
    - Links in the navigation bar change to red when hovered over.

2. **Forms**:
    - Forms have rounded corners, light gray backgrounds, and padding for a clean layout.
    - Input fields and buttons are styled uniformly with proper spacing and sizes.

3. **Buttons**:
    - Buttons are styled in red, inspired by the Syrian flag, with a hover effect that changes the background to black.

4. **Pagination**:
    - Pagination links are styled with rounded corners, padding, and hover effects for a modern look.

5. **Edit Button**:
    - the edit button now is styled to have the same appearance as the rest of the website.

---

### 1. **Authentication System**

Authentication was implemented using Laravel Breeze, which provides pre-built routes, views, and controllers for login, registration, and password management.

**Why It Was Added**:

Authentication ensures secure access to the system, protecting sensitive user data and functionality. It forms the backbone of any modern web application, enabling personalized experiences for users.

**Benefits**:

- Secure login and registration.

- Password reset functionality.

- Email verification for added security.

**Code Example: Authentication Routes**



Route::middleware('guest')->group(function () {

Route::get('login', [AuthenticatedSessionController::class, 'create'])->name('login');

Route::post('login', [AuthenticatedSessionController::class, 'store']);

Route::post('logout', [AuthenticatedSessionController::class, 'destroy'])->name('logout');

});

* * * * *

**2\. Role-Based Access Control **

RBAC introduces roles like admin and user, controlling who can access specific parts of the application. This was implemented using a role column in the users table and custom middleware.

**Why It Was Added**: RBAC enhances security by limiting sensitive actions to authorized users (e.g., only admins can manage data). It also allows different user experiences based on roles.

**Code Example: Role Middleware**

php

Copy code

public function handle($request, Closure $next, $role)

{

    if (!Auth::check() || Auth::user()->role !== $role) {

            abort(403, 'Unauthorized');

 }

return $next($request);

}

**Example Usage in Routes**

php

Copy code

Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:admin'])->group(function () {

Route::get('/admin', function () {

return view('admin.dashboard');

 });

});

* * * * *

**3\. Enhanced Input Validation**

Server-side validation ensures that all user inputs meet specific criteria before being processed.

**Why It Was Added**:

-   To prevent invalid or malicious data from entering the system.
-   To provide real-time feedback to users when they make mistakes.

**Features**:

-   Validation rules for registration, login, and CRUD forms.
-   Descriptive error messages.

**Code Example: Validation Rules**

php

Copy code

$request->validate([

'name' => 'required|string|max:255',

'email' => 'required|email|unique:users',

'password' => 'required|min:8|confirmed',

]);

* * * * *

**4\. Improved Search Functionality**

A dynamic search feature was added to allow users to search cities, hotels, and reviews quickly and efficiently.

**Why It Was Added**:

-   To improve user experience by enabling quick data retrieval.
-   To make the application scalable and user-friendly for large datasets.

**Features**:

-   JavaScript-based filtering for instant results.
-   Backend query optimization for efficient searches.

**Code Example: JavaScript Search**

js

Copy code

document.getElementById('search').addEventListener('input', function(e) {

const query = e.target.value.toLowerCase();

document.querySelectorAll('.city-card').forEach(function(card) {

const name = card.querySelector('.city-name').innerText.toLowerCase();

card.style.display = name.includes(query) ? 'block' : 'none';

});

});

* * * * *

**5\. Dynamic Home Page**

The home page now dynamically displays data such as cities, reviews, and hotels. This was achieved by fetching data from the database and displaying it using Laravel's Blade templates.

**Why It Was Added**: To give users an overview of the available data and improve engagement.

**Features**:

-   Pagination for better navigation.
-   Relationship-based data display (e.g., reviews linked to cities).

**Code Example: Data Fetching in Controller**

php

Copy code

public function index()

{

$cities = City::with('reviews', 'hotels')->paginate(10);

return view('home', compact('cities'));

}

**Code Example: Blade Template**

blade

Copy code

@foreach ($cities as $city)

<div class="city-card">

<h2>{{ $city->city_name }}</h2>

<p>Tourist Sites: {{ $city->tour_site_name }}</p>

<p>Reviews: {{ $city->reviews->count() }}</p>

</div>

@endforeach

* * * * *

**6\. Modern UI with Tailwind CSS**

Tailwind CSS was used to style the application, providing a modern, responsive design.

**Why It Was Added**: To create a visually appealing and mobile-friendly interface with minimal effort.

**Features**:

-   Consistent styling across components.
-   Responsive layouts for mobile and desktop.

**Code Example: Tailwind Styling**

html

Copy code

<div class="container mx-auto bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">

<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Welcome to the City Explorer</h1>

</div>

* * * * *

**7\. Session Management**

Sessions were switched to database-backed storage for enhanced security and scalability.

**Why It Was Added**:

-   File-based sessions are less secure and not scalable for production.
-   Database sessions allow centralized session management.

**Code Example: ****.env**** Configuration**

plaintext

Copy code

SESSION_DRIVER=database

SESSION_LIFETIME=120

**Migration for Sessions Table**

php

Copy code

Schema::create('sessions', function (Blueprint $table) {

$table->string('id')->primary();

$table->foreignId('user_id')->nullable()->index();

$table->string('ip_address', 45)->nullable();

$table->text('user_agent')->nullable();

$table->longText('payload');

$table->integer('last_activity')->index();

});

* * * * *

**8\. Fixes for 404 Errors**

Initially, the application encountered 404 Not Found errors due to missing route definitions and improper handling of unauthenticated users.

**Fix Implemented**:

-   Added a redirect to the login page for unauthenticated users.
-   Ensured all routes were correctly defined in web.php.

**Code Example: Redirect for Unauthenticated Users**

php

Copy code

Route::get('/', function () {

if (!Auth::check()) {

return redirect('login');

}

return view('home');

});

* * * * *

**9\. CRUD Operations**

Fully implemented CRUD for Cities, Reviews, and Hotels with proper relationships.

**Why It Was Added**: To allow data management directly within the application.

**Features**:

-   Create, read, update, delete functionality for all models.
-   Admin-only access for sensitive operations.

**Code Example: Cities Controller**

php

Copy code

public function store(Request $request)

{

$request->validate([

'city_name' => 'required|string|max:255',

'tour_site_name' => 'required|string',

'cost' => 'required|numeric',

]);

City::create($request->all());

return redirect()->back()->with('success', 'City added successfully!');

}

* * * * *

**Usage**

**Access Credentials**

-   **Admin**:

-   Email: admin@example.com
-   Password: password

-   **User**:

-   Email: user@example.com
-   Password: password

**Routes:**

-   /: Home page (displays Cities, Reviews, Hotels).
-   /dashboard: User dashboard (requires authentication).
-   /admin: Admin dashboard (restricted to admin role).
-   /profile: Profile management (authentication required).
-   /register: register to login
-   /login: login if your're already registered

**Pagination Implementation**

This project uses a custom pagination template to display a list of cities. The pagination is designed to show a range of page numbers around the current page, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**Key Features:**

-   Displays **2 pages on each side** of the current page.
-   Handles edge cases (e.g., first page, last page) gracefully.
-   Uses Laravel's built-in LengthAwarePaginator for efficient pagination logic.

* * * * *

**How It Works**

1.  **Custom Pagination Template**:\
    The pagination template is located at resources/views/vendor/pagination/custom.blade.php. It uses Laravel's onEachSide method to generate a range of page numbers around the current page.
2.  **Integration in the View**:\
    The pagination is integrated into the cities.index view using the links method. The appends method ensures that query parameters (e.g., search) are preserved across pagination links.
3.  **Shell Command to Publish Pagination Views**:\
    To customize the pagination views, you need to publish Laravel's default pagination templates. Run the following Artisan command:

    This command creates a vendor folder inside resources/views with the default pagination templates. You can then modify the custom.blade.php file as shown above.

* * * * *

**Why This Approach?**

-   **Efficiency**: Uses Laravel's built-in methods (onEachSide, links) to handle pagination logic.
-   **Customizability**: Easily adjust the number of pages shown on each side by changing the argument in onEachSide.
-   **User-Friendly**: Provides a clean and intuitive navigation experience for users.

* * * * *
code:

<div class="pagination-container">\
<ul class="pagination">\
{{-- Previous Page Link --}}\
@if ($paginator->onFirstPage())\
<li class="page-item disabled"><span class="page-link">&laquo;</span></li>\
@else\
<li class="page-item">\
<a class="page-link" href="{{ $paginator->previousPageUrl() }}" rel="prev">&laquo;</a>\
</li>\
@endif

{{-- Page Numbers --}}\
@foreach ($paginator->onEachSide(2)->links()->elements[0] as $page => $url)\
@if ($page == $paginator->currentPage())\
<li class="page-item active"><span class="page-link">{{ $page }}</span></li>\
@else\
<li class="page-item">\
<a class="page-link" href="{{ $url }}">{{ $page }}</a>\
</li>\
@endif\
@endforeach

{{-- Next Page Link --}}\
@if ($paginator->hasMorePages())\
<li class="page-item">\
<a class="page-link" href="{{ $paginator->nextPageUrl() }}" rel="next">&raquo;</a>\
</li>\
@else\
<li class="page-item disabled"><span class="page-link">&raquo;</span></li>\
@endif\
</ul>\
</div>

**Challenges and Analysis**

**Key Challenges:**

1.  **404 Errors**:

-   **Issue**: Missing route definitions and improper redirections.
-   **Solution**: Fixed by properly defining routes and adding login redirection.

2. **Error, Not Found:**
-   **issue**: not able to login to my dashboard as i wasnt logged in, and there isnt any route to direct to the registration file.
-   **solution**: adding routes to connect between the error page to direct to the registration, and then a button to the dashboard.

3.  **Seeders and Migrations**:

-   **Issue**: Duplicate seeders and migration conflicts caused errors.
-   **Solution**: Consolidated seeders and ensured migration consistency.

4.  **Role Management**:

-   **Issue**: Incorrect role validation logic in middleware.
-   **Solution**: Implemented and tested middleware thoroughly.

5.  **Improved Search Logic**:

-   **Analysis**: Enhanced the user experience by providing dynamic search functionality.
