# Syrian Cities and Sites Web Application

## Introduction
This is a simple web application created using the Laravel framework.
It allows users to view, search, and add cities and the site to see from Syria. 
The application includes a search feature, pagination, user input validation, and custom CSS styling inspired by the Syrian flag. 
The goal is to make the application easy to use and visually appealing while following good programming practices.

--------------------

## Features

### 1. Search for Cities
The application has a search bar where users can type the name of a city to find it. For example, if you type "Damascus" in the search bar, only the city of Damascus will be shown. This feature makes it easier to find specific cities.

**How it works:**
- The `CityController` handles the search feature by filtering cities based on what the user types.
- Laravel's `when` method is used to check if there is a search query and filter the cities accordingly.

**Code:**
```php
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $search = $request->input('search'); // Get the search input

    // Filter cities based on the search query
    $cities = City::when($search, function ($query, $search) {
        $query->where('city_name', 'like', "%{$search}%");
    })->paginate(5)->appends(['search' => $search]); // Paginate and keep the search query

    return view('cities.index', ['cities' => $cities]);
}
```
-----------------------

## 2. Pagination
The application divides the list of cities into smaller pages to make navigation easier. Each page shows 5 cities. Pagination links are displayed at the bottom of the page, allowing users to move between pages easily.

**How it works:**
- The `paginate` method is used in the controller to limit the number of cities displayed per page.
- The `links` method is used in the Blade template to generate the pagination links automatically.

**Code:**
```php
// CityController.php
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $search = $request->input('search'); // Get the search query

    // Fetch filtered and paginated cities
    $cities = City::when($search, function ($query, $search) {
        $query->where('city_name', 'like', "%{$search}%");
    })->paginate(5)->appends(['search' => $search]); // Paginate with 5 results per page

    return view('cities.index', ['cities' => $cities]);
}

```
-----------------------

### 3. User Input Validation
The application uses Laravel's built-in validation to ensure that user inputs are correct before saving them to the database. This ensures data integrity and prevents invalid data from being processed. If the validation fails, the user is shown helpful error messages, making it easy to correct their inputs.

**How Validation is Implemented:**
- The `validate()` method is used in both the `store` and `update` methods of the `CityController`.
- The rules ensure:
    - The `city_name` and `tour_site_name` are required, must be strings, and cannot exceed 255 characters.
    - The `cost` field is required, must be numeric, and cannot be less than 0.

**Example Code:**
```php
// Validation in the CityController
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $validated = $request->validate([
        'city_name' => 'required|string|max:255',
        'tour_site_name' => 'required|string|max:255',
        'cost' => 'required|numeric|min:0',
    ]);

    City::create($validated);

    return redirect('/cities')->with('success', 'City added successfully!');
}

```

### 4. Custom Styling
The application is styled using custom CSS inspired by the colors of the Syrian flag. The design is clean, simple, and focused on providing a good user experience. Key elements like the navigation bar, forms, buttons, and pagination have been styled to ensure the application is visually appealing and easy to use.

**Key Styling Features:**

1. **Navigation Bar**:
    - The navigation bar is styled with a black background and white text.
    - Links in the navigation bar change to red when hovered over.

2. **Forms**:
    - Forms have rounded corners, light gray backgrounds, and padding for a clean layout.
    - Input fields and buttons are styled uniformly with proper spacing and sizes.

3. **Buttons**:
    - Buttons are styled in red, inspired by the Syrian flag, with a hover effect that changes the background to black.

4. **Pagination**:
    - Pagination links are styled with rounded corners, padding, and hover effects for a modern look.

Thank you, hopefully you can get to see Syria once it's safe. :)
